# Question-4-Brownian-motion
Q4 of reproducible research homework 

**Question 4**  
**Execute the code to produce the paths of two random walks. What do you observe?**  
The code shows an example of modelled randomness through Brownian motion, which can be used to model the motion of particles as a result of their collisions with other surrounding particles. These collisions are random, but can be observed through the execution of random walks. 
When the provided code is executed, two plots are produced which each demonstrate a randomly generated walk (with the same number of steps), using the ggplot2 and gridExtra packages. The plots are produced simultaneously using ncol, and demonstrate the path of the walk and the progression of time, shown through a colour gradient (earlier times are darker blue, later times are light blue). The graphs can therefore be used to show the random motion of a particle within a two-dimensional plane (x,y) according to time, and the previous movement of the particle- determined through the random orientation/angle of the particle in the 2Ï€ range, and also coordiantes randomly generated through sine and cosine functions.
